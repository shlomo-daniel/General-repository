                <p><strong>The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky</strong><sup>[c]</sup> is a 2004 role-playing video
                    game
                    developed by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon_Falcom"> Nihon Falcom</a>
                    . The game
                    is the first in what later became known as the <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trails_(series)">Trails</a> series, itself a part of the
                    larger
                    The
                    Legend of Heroes
                    series.
                </p>

                <p>Trails in the Sky was first released in Japan for Windows and was later ported to the <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> in
                    2006. North American video game publisher Xseed Games acquired the rights from Falcom, but did not
                    release
                    it
                    until 2011 due to the game's large amount of text necessary to translate and localize. A
                    high-definition
                    port to
                    the PlayStation 3 was released in 2012, while a remaster for the PlayStation Vita was released in
                    2015;
                    both
                    were only released in Japan. A direct sequel, Trails in the Sky SC, was released in 2006.

        <p>In Trails in the Sky, the player controls a cast of characters, embarking on quests to progress the story.
            There
            are two different types of maps when navigating the overworld, field maps and town maps. In field maps,
            enemies
            roam around and a battle ensues if the player comes into contact with one. In town maps, the player can
            visit
            various shops to purchase items, replenish health at an inn and, for the major cities, take on and report
            quests
            to the local guild. Quests can be a variety of tasks for the player, ranging from defeating monsters in the
            field map to delivering items and finding lost cats in town. In addition, the player can interact with
            numerous
            non-playable characters (NPCs). A unique aspect in Trails in the Sky is that each NPC's dialogue changes as
            the
            story progresses, allowing players to follow their accompanying side stories throughout the game. [1] The
            game
            features 8 playable characters, who apart from the protagonists Estelle and Joshua, rotate in and out of the
            party while playing the main story. The story itself is split into five different portions, with a prologue
            followed by four chapters.</p>
        <div class="battle02">

            <span>battle screenshot</span>
        </div>

        <p>Combat takes place on a grid and is turn-based. The character's turn order is determined by a tracker called
            the
            AT Bar. During the character's turn, the player can move or make an attack. In addition to the normal
            attack,
            each character also has three other methods available for action: Arts, Crafts, and S-Crafts. Arts are magic
            spells characters can use to attack opponents or support teammates but must take an additional turn to cast.
            Crafts are character-specific abilities that are similar to Arts but can be used in the same turn; however,
            they
            utilize a special gauge called "Craft Points" (CP) for the cost to perform. S-Crafts are powered-up Crafts
            that
            can be performed once a character has over 100CP but completely depletes the CP gauge upon using it. Further
            extending S-Crafts are S-Breaks which allows characters to immediately perform an S-Craft regardless of when
            their turn order is.[2][3] An additional aspect of combat is AT Bonuses which grant bonus effects at certain
            turns throughout the battle, visible on the AT Bar.[2][3] If the player loses a battle, the game is over.
            The
            player is then allowed to continuously retry the battle and subsequently lower the difficulty of the battle
            for
            each retry. Earlier versions of the game included two difficulty settings, Normal and Hard, while later
            versions
            introduced a third difficulty known as Nightmare</p>
        <h2 id="Synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The game follows protagonists Estelle Bright and her adopted brother Joshua, who journey through the country
            of
            Liberl to train to become senior Bracers, members of a non-government multinational organization that acts
            to
            keep the peace and protect civilians. During the journey they get embroiled in and eventually stop an
            attempted
            coup to overthrow the monarchy.</p>
        <p>During the celebratory party after the incident is resolved, Joshua encounters professor Alba, whom they met
            during their quest. Alba reveals that he is actually Georg Weissmann, a member of a secret crime
            organization
            called Ouroboros, who had been forcing Joshua to unknowingly act as their spy on the Bright family. After
            Weissman fully restores Joshua's memories, Joshua decides to leave the Bracer Guild to take on the society
            independently, but not before confessing his feelings to Estelle (while drugging her so he could not be
            followed).</p>
        <h2 id="Release">Release</h2>

        <p>Trails in the Sky was initially released for Windows on June 29, 2004, in Japan. The game was later ported to
            the
            PlayStation Portable and released in Japan on October 28, 2006. The PSP version was later released by Xseed
            Games in North America on March 29, 2011, and in Europe on November 4. The Windows version was released
            worldwide on July 29, 2014, and included a number of features from the PlayStation Portable version.[4] A
            high-definition update, The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky FC Kai HD Edition, was released for the
            PlayStation 3 in Japan on December 13, 2012.[5]</p>
        <p>A remaster, The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky FC Evolution, was released in Japan for the PlayStation
            Vita
            on June 11, 2015.[6] Evolution updates the user interface and incorporates new features such as voice
            acting,
            redesigned character portraits, and a new animated opening cutscene.[7][8]</p>
        <h2 id="Localization">Localization</h2>
        <p>The game was localized into English by Xseed Games, who had acquired the rights to bring the Trails in the
            Sky
            trilogy to North America in May 2010.[9][10] The length of the script for Trails in the Sky FC, which
            contains
            approximately 1.5 million Japanese characters, presented a challenge for the team's editors.[11] Jessica
            Chavez,
            the game's lead editor, spent nine months working on the script. Chavez stated that she would frequently
            work
            over 11-12 hours for six days a week.[11][12] In 2013, Xseed planned a Windows version of Trails in the Sky
            to
            be released in early 2014,[13] but coding issues forced the release date to be pushed back to July.
            According to
            Xseed localization programmer Sara Leen, much of the code needed to be rewritten from scratch because of
            technical differences between the PlayStation Portable and Windows versions; these changes frequently
            introduced
            new software bugs, further complicating matters.[4]</p>
        <h2 id="Reception">Reception</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Trails in the Sky received "generally favorable" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic.[14][15]
            Neilie Johnson of IGN gave it a positive review, stating that, though "First Chapter is not the most
            original
            ever made, like any good JRPG it offers amusing writing, dynamic combat, interesting tasks, an absorbing
            narrative, and hours upon hours of gameplay" and concluded that "while the game's 50/50 balance between
            combat
            and story may not be to everyone's taste, its charm and overall entertainment value make it well worth the
            investment".[21] Hardcore Gamer praised the "rock-solid character writing", noting every character has
            "their
            own history, ambitions, and social connections", every non-player character (NPC) "has their own name and
            motivations and interpersonal relationships with other NPCs", and the influence of Hayao Miyazaki's classic
            anime film Castle in the Sky on the cast and steampunk setting. They also praised the open-ended story,
            quest
            design, and combat system, and for having "one of the most complete and enthralling worlds ever rendered",
            concluding it to be "one of the finest JRPGs in the history of the genre".[1]</p>
        <p>Despite the series's popularity in Japan,[29] Trails in the Sky FC sold poorly in the West upon its initial
            release for the PSP,[30] but was later ported to the Playstation Vita and PC, which USGamer's Kat Bailey
            described the game managing to jump to two platforms.[31][clarification needed]</p><br><br>
